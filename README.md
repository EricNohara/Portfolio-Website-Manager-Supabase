## Project Description

- All in one platform for managing software engineer/general portfolio websites
- Allows updating user information in a single place without having to interface with portfolio website's source code
- Provides an easy to navigate user interface for updating, adding, or deleting user information
- Provides an easy to use API to access all user's information, all in one place
- Easy integration into user's preexisting portfolios, with the ability to get all user data with one fetch
- Eliminate any need for manual updates to the source code of portfolio websites
- Changes made on this application are seamlessly pushed to connected websites via the API
- Built with **Supabase** and **Next.js** for scalability, performance, security, and ease of development
- Utilize custom build AWS Lambda Function to periodically call the public API to ensure the Supabase project stays active (needed since I am using the free tier)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Fullstack framework used for building a fast, responsive, user-friendly interface
  - [MUI](https://mui.com/) - Used for simple and easy components
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Used for efficient styling
- **Backend**:
  - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Open-source alternative to Firebase for authentication, hosted database management, and file storage
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Used for AWS Lambda Function which periodically calls the API to keep the Supabase project active
- **Hosting**:
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Optimized to be hosted on vercel for cheap and easy deployment
  - [AWS Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - Simple and cheap way to schedule periodic API calls to keep the Supabase project active

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

## Supabase Backend Setup

1. Follow [these steps](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started) to sign into supabase and create a new project
2. Add database tables with the [schema](./doc/assets/schema.pdf) provided
3. Create storage buckets for portraits, resumes, transcripts, and project thumbnails
4. Follow [these steps](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) to add RLS policies to every table, only allowing users to access and mutate their own data when they are signed in
5. Set a minimum password length in the auth dashboard
6. Copy the following information for .env.local file:
   - The public url of the project
   - The ANON key for the project
   - The service role key for the project

## How to Install and Run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-manager.git
```

2. Enter root directory

```bash
cd portfolio-manager
```

3. Create a valid .env.local file in the root of the project

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=""
NEXT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=""
API_ENCRYPTION_KEY="64 character key"
MIN_PASSWORD_LEN=6
```

4. Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## AWS Lambda Function Supabase Uptime Trigger

The free tier of Supabase automatically freezes a project after a period of inactivity. This is problematic since any connected portfolio website would stop working if this occurs. To fix this, I wrote a simple AWS Lambda Function in Python to make periodic calls to the public API. This ensures that the project will never be frozen.

## Known Issues

No known issues.

## Next Steps

- Update database and attributes for tables
- Update API table for PER APP api keys
- Add a table in the DB for storing calls that users make to their public endpoints
- UI/UX update (remove all alerts and redo the user interface)
  - Disable all buttons when loading
  - Migrate from tailwind + MUI to using CSS modules
- Add unit/integration testing
- Support more languages through new libraries (Python, Java, C#, etc.)
- Documentation page for API + code integrations
- Rename application
- Add ads to website
- Test with live users
- Monetize

## Eventual Work Items

- Add search functionality to easily find fields to view/edit
- Allow for other file upload types
- Add AI feature for generating text for descriptions
- Migrate backend to external application
  - Reintegrate the web app with this external backend
  - Create CLI
  - Create desktop app
